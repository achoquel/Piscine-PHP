<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles Vector creation.

An instance can be constructed from a table constituted of dest Vertex
and orig Vertex (optional);

y axis
^
|       ->
|       AB
|  A x---------> B
|
0--------------------> x axis
z axis

dest is an instance of Vertex class and defines the B point of the vector.
orig is an instance of Vertex class and defines the A point of the vector.

If not specified, orig value is by default x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1.
If not specified, color value is by default white.

The class provides the following methods :

float   magnitude( );
Returns the magnitude of the instance's vector.

Vector  normalize( );
Returns the normal vector of the instance's vector.

Vector  add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum vector of instance's vector and $rhs vector.

Vector  sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of instance's vector and $rhs vector.

Vector  opposite( );
Returns the opposite vector of instance's vector.

Vector  scalarProduct( float $k );
Returns the vector resulting of the scalar product between instance's vector and
$k.

Vector  dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the vector resulting of the scalar product between instance's vector and
$rhs vector.

float   cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosine of the angle formed by instance's vector and $rhs vector.

Vector  crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the vector resulting of the vectorial product between instance's vector
and $rhs vector.
