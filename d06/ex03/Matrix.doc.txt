<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles MATRIX creation.

An instance can be constructed from an array constituted of:

preset: type of matrix that we want, can either be:
  - IDENTITY
  - SCALE
  - RX (for Rotation along the OX axis)
  - RY (for Rotation along the OY axis)
  - RZ (for Rotation along the OZ axis)
  - TRANSLATION
  - PROJECTION

scale: scale factor (mandatory for SCALE matrix)
angle: rotation angle (mandatory for RX,RY,RZ matrix)
vtc: translation vector (mandatory for TRANSLATION matrix)
fov: field of view (mandatory for PROJECTION matrix)
ratio: projected image ratio (mandatory for PROJECTION matrix)
near: near clipping plane (mandatory for PROJECTION matrix)
far: far clipping plane (mandatory for PROJECTION matrix)

The class provides the following methods :

Matrix  mult( Matrix $rhs );
Returns the result of the instance's matrix times the $rhs matrix.

Vertex  transformVertex( Vertex $vtx );
Returns the result of the transformation of $vtx vertex by instance's matrix.
